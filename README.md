# Sangjit Invitation — Ivan × Sioni

Static, mobile-first digital invitation for the Sangjit (Chinese engagement) of **Ivan Rusli & Sara Sioni Santoso** (Sara goes by *Sioni*) on **11 July 2026**.

Built as plain HTML + CSS + JS, no build step. Designed to open smoothly on mobile for elderly guests, with a garden-Chinese aesthetic (ivory + foliage green + pastel peony + champagne gold, jade accents from the ceremony attire).

## Quick preview

Open `index.html` directly in any modern browser, or serve the folder:

```bash
cd /Users/mcdohl/projects/sioni
python3 -m http.server 8080
# then visit http://localhost:8080
```

Try a personalised link:

```
http://localhost:8080/?to=Bapak%20Budi%20Santoso
```

## Things you still need to fill in

Search `index.html` for `TODO` comments. Placeholders:

| Where | What |
|---|---|
| `index.html` → `.families` section | Parents' names for both sides |
| `index.html` → `.event` section | (optional) Full street address below the venue name |
| `assets/img/hero.svg` | Hero / cover background (swap with real photo if desired) |
| `assets/audio/background.mp3` | Looping Chinese-themed background music (see `assets/audio/README.txt`) |

### Swapping the hero image (optional)

Replace `assets/img/hero.svg` with a JPG/PNG at 1200×1500 px or larger, then update the `<img src>` in `index.html` to match the new extension. Compress with [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/) or [Squoosh](https://squoosh.app/) to stay under ~300 KB.

### Updating the venue (already set: Authentic Coffeeshop)

The map is pinned to Authentic Coffeeshop (`-7.0923364, 110.9054284`). If the venue changes:

1. Open [Google Maps](https://maps.google.com), search for the new venue.
2. Click **Share** → **Embed a map** → copy the `src` and paste into the `.event-map iframe` in `index.html`.
3. Update the `href` on the "Buka di Google Maps" `<a id="mapBtn">` button with the share link (short `maps.app.goo.gl/...` URL works fine).

## Per-guest personalised links

Append `?to=` with the guest's name (URL-encoded):

```
https://your-site.example.com/?to=Bapak%20dan%20Ibu%20Hadi
```

The opening cover will greet them by name. When they tap **Share via WhatsApp**, the `?to=` is stripped so the shared link is clean.

Tip: use a spreadsheet to build a list of personalised links. Column A = guest name, column B:

```
=CONCATENATE("https://your-site.example.com/?to=", ENCODEURL(A2))
```

## Deploying to GitHub Pages (free)

   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin git@github.com:<your-user>/sangjit-ivan-sara.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```
3. In the GitHub repo → **Settings → Pages** → **Source**: `Deploy from a branch` → `main` / root → **Save**.
4. After a minute, your invitation will be live at `https://<your-user>.github.io/sangjit-ivan-sara/`.
